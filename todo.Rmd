# To do

- dump each days data into monetdb (+)
- parse datetime data into nicer format, separate features (+)
- spatial visualisation prototype (+)
- refactor code, funs in separate files (+)
- add distance to Rembrandtplein as feature to each event (obs) (+)
- write docs
- tests, especially the scraping stuff
- check out googledrive pkg for web api's testing 
- consider switching to crul pkg for async requests
- make it a package
- make all funs that call apis more safe (safely ...)
- idea: pull only results from simfuny that are _actually_ within
  the range of Rembrandtplein (filter out stuff in Paradiso etc.)
- partyflock scraper 

# Ideas

- spatio-temporal event analysis 
  - clustering of highly-popular events in certain area
  - data mining of temporal patterns e.g. 1st Saturday of each month very busy
